                                                      Introduction

 •Nowadays, the percentage of mobile usage compared to desktop is continually increasing. Android holds approximately 53.2% of the smartphone market, while iOS commands a 43% share.

 •When it comes to app preferences, we aim to determine whether users tend to download paid or free apps more frequently. 

 •Additionally, we analyze the ratings associated with these apps and provide visualizations to illustrate the findings.

 •For this analysis, we employ the K-Means machine learning algorithm.
